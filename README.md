# Transmission-line-parameters
This MATLAB code is to calculate transmission line parameters inductance and capacitance of single and three phase ,single and double circuit transmission line.

Main Changes:
Fixed errors in impedance calculation
Fixed errors in constants
Fixed units
Added error andling
Replaced clunky if nest with a switch 

Units: All calculations are per meter length of the transmission line
Assumptions: Conductors are assumed to be straight, parallel, and infinitely long
